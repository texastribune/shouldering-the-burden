  <p><strong>If there is a Texas Miracle, it’s hard to see it from where María Ayala is sitting.</strong></p>
  <p>The Mission woman, her oilfield worker husband and their five children have lived for years in an unfinished home where the second-story windows were never installed. The family only manages to make ends meet by spending half of each year away from Texas, in Indiana, where they pick corn.</p>
  <p>Lone Star State leaders such as Gov. Rick Perry often tout the Texas Miracle – the idea that the state’s economy is thriving thanks to its small-government approach.</p>
  <p>“Every day, more Texans are going to work, earning a living and supporting their families because we follow a simple recipe for job creation: we keep our taxes low, our regulations effective and predictable, our courts fair and our schools accountable,” Perry said in a statement earlier this year.</p>
  <p>But Texas is also the state with the highest rate in the nation of people without health insurance. And it ranks last in the percentage of people age 25 and older who have completed high school.</p>
  <p>“That miracle has left a lot of people out of the picture,” said Celia Cole, CEO of the Texas Food Bank Network. “All the policies that the governor touts and that other people tout when they talk about the Texas Miracle are policies that have been put in place to help businesses and to help people at the upper end of the economic ladder with little regard for the struggles that people at the other end of the economic ladder are facing.”</p>
  <p>Even as Texas’ oil and gas boom brings high-paying jobs, not everyone is benefiting. Juan Carlos Pacheco is one of many Child Protective Services caseworkers struggling to find affordable housing in the Midland and Odessa area, where the boom has driven up rents.</p>
  <p>Perry often speaks of the importance of Texas’ small businesses, and of tax cuts he pushed that have helped them.</p>
  <p>But Mike Bryan of San Antonio is a small-business owner who is struggling so much to make ends meet at his auto-repair shop that in the fall, the father of three became one of nearly 4 million Texans on food stamps.</p>
  <p>“We might be doing good in the economy,” Bryan said of Texas, “but we could do a lot better.”</p>
  <p>Jerome Johnson of Fort Worth has struggled to land a decent-paying job despite having a bachelor’s degree and years of work experience. Austin mother Claudia Salazar is often forced to choose between paying for electricity or rent. And Houston nurse Tiffany Richardson fell so far into debt on an auto-title loan after her mother’s illness that their two cars were repossessed.</p>
  <p>Here are the stories of six people from across Texas — Ayala, Pacheco, Bryan, Johnson, Salazar and Richardson — who have found that, at least in their corners of the state, there is no miracle.</p>

    <p>James Richard "Rick" Perry (born March 4, 1950) is an American politician who is the 47th and current governor of Texas. A Republican, he was elected lieutenant governor of Texas in 1998 and assumed the governorship in December 2000 when then-governor George W. Bush resigned to become president of the United States. Perry is the longest serving governor in Texas state history. As a result, he is the only governor in modern Texas history to have appointed at least one person to every eligible state office, board, or commission position (as well as to several elected offices to which the governor can appoint someone to fill an unexpired term, such as six of the nine current members of the Texas Supreme Court).</p>
    <p>Perry was elected to full gubernatorial terms in 2002, 2006 and 2010 and is the fourth Texas governor (after Allan Shivers, Price Daniel, and John Connally) to serve three terms. With a tenure in office to date of 13 years, 230 days, Perry is the second longest serving current U.S. governor – after Terry Branstad of Iowa. Perry served as chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 2008 (succeeding Sonny Perdue of Georgia) and again in 2011.[2]</p>
    <p>Perry won the Texas 2010 Republican gubernatorial primary election, defeating U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and former Wharton County Republican Party Chairwoman and businesswoman Debra Medina.[3] In the 2010 Texas gubernatorial election, Perry won a third term by defeating former Houston mayor Bill White and Kathie Glass.[4]</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>Abbott was born on November 13, 1957 in Wichita Falls, Texas and was reared in Duncanville in Dallas County. He graduated from Duncanville High School.[3]</p>
    <p>In 1981, he earned a Bachelor of Business Administration in finance from the University of Texas at Austin, where he was a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. In 1984, he earned his law degree from the Vanderbilt University Law School in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
    <p>He went into private practice, working for Butler and Binion, LLC between 1984 and 1992. Abbott’s political career began in Houston, where he served as a state trial judge in the 129th District Court for three years.</p>
    <p>Abbott became a paraplegic when an oak tree fell on him while he was running following a storm in 1984.[4][5] He had two steel rods implanted in his spine, underwent extensive rehabilitation at TIRR Memorial Hermann in Houston, and has used a wheelchair ever since.[6][7] He sued the homeowner and won an insurance settlement worth more than $10 million.[8] Abbott later championed laws capping punitive damages like those for which he was eligible in his own suit to two times the amount of economic damages awarded plus $750,000.[9] While the current law caps punitive damages, which are meant to punish gross negligence or bad faith, the law still allows payments for medical costs, potential lost wages, economic damages and noneconomic losses, such as pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life. Matt Hirsch, a spokesman for the Abbott campaign, said the attorney general did not seek punitive damages in his lawsuit.[10]</p>
    <p>Then-Texas Governor George W. Bush appointed Abbott to the Texas Supreme Court, and he was then twice elected to the state's highest civil court—in 1996 (two-year term) and 1998 (six-year term). In 1996, Abbott had no Democratic opponent but was challenged by Libertarian John B. Hawley of Dallas. Abbott defeated Hawley 84%-16%.[11] In 1998, Abbott defeated Democrat David Van Os 60%-40%.[12]</p>
    <p>In 2001, he went back to private practice and worked for Bracewell & Giuliani, LLC.[1] He was also an adjunct professor at University of Texas School of Law.[13]</p>
