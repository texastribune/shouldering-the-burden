<div class="prose intro">
  <p>If there is a Texas Miracle, it’s hard to see it from where María Ayala is sitting.
  The Mission woman, her oilfield worker husband and their five children have lived for years in an unfinished home where the second-story windows were never installed. The family only manages to make ends meet by spending half of each year away from Texas, in Indiana, where they pick corn.</p>
  <p>“Every day, more Texans are going to work, earning a living and supporting their families because we follow a simple recipe for job creation: We keep our taxes low, our regulations effective and predictable, our courts fair and our schools accountable,” Perry said in a statement earlier this year.</p>
  <p>“That miracle has left a lot of people out of the picture,” said Celia Cole, CEO of the Texas Food Bank Network. “All the policies that the governor touts and that other people tout when they talk about the Texas Miracle are policies that have been put in place to help businesses and to help people at the upper end of the economic ladder with little regard for the struggles that people at the other end of the economic ladder are facing.”</p>

    <p>MISSION — If it weren’t for the black truck and small trailer parked outside María Ayala’s unfinished home, it would be easy to assume that it had been abandoned — which it is for half the year.</p>
    <p>Ayala, her husband José and the youngest three of their five children live in the family homein Mission during the fall and winter. But every April, the Ayalas trek to Indiana, where they pick corn and live in trailer homes.</p>
    <p>“Whenever we’re in Indiana, we’re never short on money,” said Ayala, 43, which has been under construction for four years.</p>
    <p>Ayala speaks fondly about the family’s time as migrant workers in Indiana — despite the fact that one year, her daughter Debora, now 13, had to be rushed to the hospital when she fell ill after being sprayed with pesticide.</p>
    <p>While sitting at her kitchen table in Texas one day last spring, Ayala emphasized how much the fields in Indiana have given her family, pointing out the newly installed glass panels on the windows.</p>
    <p>She is proud of the home she and her relatives have slowly built with the money they bring back at the end of every picking season. This past year, they added a roof, which had not been finished when they first moved in. At that time, the house was also missing its doors.</p>
    <p>They had previously lived in a much smaller home on the property that doubled as a family bakery. That business was their main source of income while in Texas until the building burned in a fire last year while they were in Indiana.</p>
    <p>“We ended up with nothing,” Ayala said. “The little that we had was all stolen.”
    Ayala’s husband now works in Oklahoma’s oil fields to bring in money while she and the children are in Texas, and Ayala makes and sells tamales, primarily during the winter holidays.</p>
    <p>The Ayalas headed back to Indiana this summer and plan to return to Texas soon in time for the children’s new school year.</p>
    <p>Like every year, they’ll bring enough money back to Texas to pay the bills and add something new to their home. This year, they’re hoping to install windows on the second story of the house.</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>Abbott was born on November 13, 1957 in Wichita Falls, Texas and was reared in Duncanville in Dallas County. He graduated from Duncanville High School.[3]</p>
    <p>In 1981, he earned a Bachelor of Business Administration in finance from the University of Texas at Austin, where he was a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. In 1984, he earned his law degree from the Vanderbilt University Law School in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
    <p>He went into private practice, working for Butler and Binion, LLC between 1984 and 1992. Abbott’s political career began in Houston, where he served as a state trial judge in the 129th District Court for three years.</p>
    <p>Abbott became a paraplegic when an oak tree fell on him while he was running following a storm in 1984.[4][5] He had two steel rods implanted in his spine, underwent extensive rehabilitation at TIRR Memorial Hermann in Houston, and has used a wheelchair ever since.[6][7] He sued the homeowner and won an insurance settlement worth more than $10 million.[8] Abbott later championed laws capping punitive damages like those for which he was eligible in his own suit to two times the amount of economic damages awarded plus $750,000.[9] While the current law caps punitive damages, which are meant to punish gross negligence or bad faith, the law still allows payments for medical costs, potential lost wages, economic damages and noneconomic losses, such as pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life. Matt Hirsch, a spokesman for the Abbott campaign, said the attorney general did not seek punitive damages in his lawsuit.[10]</p>
    <p>Then-Texas Governor George W. Bush appointed Abbott to the Texas Supreme Court, and he was then twice elected to the state's highest civil court—in 1996 (two-year term) and 1998 (six-year term). In 1996, Abbott had no Democratic opponent but was challenged by Libertarian John B. Hawley of Dallas. Abbott defeated Hawley 84%-16%.[11] In 1998, Abbott defeated Democrat David Van Os 60%-40%.[12]</p>
    <p>In 2001, he went back to private practice and worked for Bracewell & Giuliani, LLC.[1] He was also an adjunct professor at University of Texas School of Law.[13]</p>
